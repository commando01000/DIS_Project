        In an organization setting, policy refers to sets of protocol that guide decisions towards achievement of goals.
        The top management in organizations develops policies. Through such policies, organizations achieve goals by
        implementation with other team members. It is imperative to note that policies may take a subjective as well as
        an objective front (Waterhouse & Rogers, 2004). In comparison to rules, policies differ in terms of
        implementation. Rules, which at times relates to laws, prohibit behaviors. However, policies in organizations
        function by merely guiding actions. Therefore, policy formulation may be the process of making important
        decisions for organizations. An example of policy in an organization may relate to its recruitment principle.
        Certain job groups may entail certain qualifications on the part of a prospective employee.
